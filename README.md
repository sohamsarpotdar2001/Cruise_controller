# Cruise-control-design-using-PID
This project was about developing a simple cruise control system with PID controller for acheiving a fixed SetPoint velocity.

## The Model -

If the inertia of the wheels is neglected, and it is assumed that air drag (which is proportional to the carâ€™s speed at low speeds) is opposing the motion of the car, then the problem is reduced to a simple first order system.

Thus the motion of the car can be written as, **mv' + bv = u** where u is the input force provided by the engine to move the car at a certain velocity. Though it is intuitive to think of an input as something related to the gas pedal, but unfortunately to represent such a system accurately the dynamics of it become very complicated. Here we assumed that our engine can give us a certain amount of force, neglecting how that force translates to real life situations.


## Results

- Parameters - 
  - Mass m = 50
  - Drag Coefficient b = 30
  - SetPoint velocity = 150m/s

### Conclusion
- Rise time of the system(time taken to reach 90% of the target velocity) = 4.6 seconds
- Maximum overshoot is less than 5%
